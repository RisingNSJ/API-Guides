# Technical Writing Samples – API and Architecture Guides
This repository contains documentation samples authored in Visual Studio.  
The content demonstrates the ability to write both conceptual guides (explaining architectures) and procedural API documentation (integration guides, error handling, request/response examples).

## Purpose
This repository is designed to:
- Showcase technical writing samples for API and integration documentation  
- Demonstrate ability to explain both procedural (step-by-step API usage) and conceptual (architecture, design) topics  
- Provide examples aligned with developer success and integration use cases  

---

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio – Authoring 
- GitHub – Version control and publishing  
- Swagger UI – Referenced for API testing workflows  

---

## Notes
- These samples are fictional but modeled after real-world API documentation practices.  
- They are intended to demonstrate writing style, clarity, and technical communication skills.
